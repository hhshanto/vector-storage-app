    "\n",
    "In the context of embeddings, dimensions refer to the individual components or features that make up a vector representation of data. Each dimension corresponds to a specific attribute or characteristic of the data being represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- Embeddings are dense vector representations of data.\n",
    "- The number of dimensions determines the size and complexity of the embedding space.\n",
    "- Dimensions capture different aspects of the data, such as semantic or syntactic features in text embeddings."

    "2. **Feature Representation**: Each dimension corresponds to a learned feature or attribute of the data.\n",
