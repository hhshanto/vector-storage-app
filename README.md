### 1. Text Embedding

```python
from src.embeddings.transformer import TransformerEmbedding

embedder = TransformerEmbedding()
vector = embedder.embed("Example text")
```

### 2. Vector Storage

```python
from src.storage.faiss_store import FaissStore

store = FaissStore(dimension=768)
store.add_vectors(vectors)
similar_vectors = store.search(query_vector, k=5)
```

### 3. Similarity Search

```python
from src.utils.similarity import cosine_similarity

similarity = cosine_similarity(vector1, vector2)
```

## Results and Findings



## Challenges and Learnings

During this project, I encountered several challenges:

1. Optimizing storage for high-dimensional vectors
2. Balancing speed and accuracy in similarity search
3. Integrating different embedding models

These challenges provided valuable learning experiences in:

- Efficient data structures for vector storage
- Approximate nearest neighbor algorithms
- Model integration and API design

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add more embedding techniques (e.g., Doc2Vec, FastText)
- [ ] Implement distributed vector storage for improved scalability
- [ ] Add visualization tools for embedding spaces
- [ ] Optimize search algorithms for specific use cases
- [ ] Expand benchmarks to include more metrics and scenarios
- [ ] Implement a simple web interface for demonstration purposes
