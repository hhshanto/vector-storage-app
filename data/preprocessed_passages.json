Do you know the people here do not shake hands as much as we do in China? And it's never a good habit to make noise when you eat.

While there is no agreement among scientists about why we dream, there are many ideas about the different kinds of dreams we have.\nOne common kind of dream is the repeating dream, in which the same story is repeated again and again, often for many months or even years. Some believe these are a sign people have a problem in their life and once that problem is gone then the dream will stop. Others think _ are a way to help people remember something very important.\nAnother well-known kind of dream is the nightmare. The pictures and stories in such dreams make people very afraid and dreamers usually remember them far more clearly than normal dreams. The cause of such dreams may be seeing something _ such as a car accident or some deadly snakes. Others think such dreams may be trying to make a person pay attention to something that is dangerous in their life.\nDaydreams happen during wake-time when we forget where we are or what we are doing and find ourselves in a made-up story or unreal world. We often daydream when we are doing something that is not interesting or exciting. They help us think about our future.\nLucid dreams are the most fun. These happen when dreamers suddenly understand that they are dreaming. Instead of waking up, they stay in the dream and are able to control what happens in the dream as if they are making a movie.",

When you get confused , don't be shy and worry to ask questions. Your new western friends may also have many questions about Chinese culture, and they may be hesitant  to ask.

But they didn't say even one word to each other. I told them about Tommy's schoolwork and behaviour. I hoped to help them see what they were doing to their son. But it looked that my words didn't work. I thought that maybe Tommy could tell them something himself.\nI found Tommy's paper in the back of his desk. Tommy has written some words on it many times. I gave the paper to Tommy's mother. She read it and gave it to his father. He read it and his face became soft . He reached for his wife's hand. She smiled up at him. My eyes were with tears. He helped her with her coat and they left together.\nI picked the paper up and looked at it again. It read: \"Dear Mommy... Dear Daddy... I love you.\"",

He may think that red, orange and yellow are all shades   of  green. Sometimes a person can't tell the difference between blue and green. Only a few unlucky men may see everything in shades of green-- a strange world indeed.\nColor blindness in human beings is a different thing to explain. In only one eye there are millions of very small things called \"cones \" . These help us to see in the bright light and to tell differences between colors. These are also millions of \"rods\" ,but these are used for seeing when it is nearly dark. They show us shapes but not colors.\nSome insects have favorite colors. Mosquitoes  like blue but do not like yellow. A red light will not attract insects, but a blue light will. Human beings also have favorite colors. Yet we are lucky. With the help of the cones in our eyes, we can see many beautiful colors by day, and with the help of the rods we can see shapes at night.",

She lives in a poor village called Zhangjiashu in Tongxin, Ningxia, and she has no money to go to school. However, she is brave and wants to go to school very much.\nHer mother gave her diary to a reporter, Pierre Haski when he went to Zhangjiashu in 2001. Now, Ma Yan's diary has been published in France, Italy, Germany, Japan and China.\nMa Yan is now a Junior Three student at Yuwang Middle School in Tongxin. Before this, she had to drop out of school twice. She had to stop going to school the first time, because her mum told her there was no money for her to go to school. She worked for 21 days and saved 13 yuan. With this money, she went back to school. The second time, her family told her she had to leave school while her two brothers could stay.\n\"I want to study,\" Ma Yan wrote in her diary. \"Why can boys study but girls can't? It would be wonderful if I could stay at school forever.\"\nMa Yan loves school so much because she wants to have a better life.\n\"My parents work hard in the fields but they are still poor. They have no knowledge . Most girls in my village leave school early and get married young. I don't want that kind of life,\" Ma Yan said.\nAfter her story became known, many students sent money to her. She hopes to go to Tsinghua University and become a reporter. \"Then, I can find poor kids like me, and help them,\" she said.",

They also listen to the News about sports, the weather, politics , and activities of the American people. Most of the radio broadcast is music.\nPop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or tape which radio stations use in every state . Once the popular singer is heard all over the country, young people buy his or her tape. Some of the money from these tapes comes to the singer. Whenever the singer goes, all the young people want to meet him or her. Now the singer has become a national star.\nThere are other kinds of music that are important to Americans. One is called folk music. It has stories about the common life of Americans. Another is called western or country music. This was started by cowboys who would sing at night to the cows they were watching. Today, any music about country boy and his girl is called western or country music. Serious music for the concert halls is called classical music. Music for instruments is called orchestra music, such as the symphonies  of Beethoven.",

Rowling wrote her first story, called Rabbit, at the age of six.\nAfter she graduated from the university, Rowling worked as a translator   in London. During this time, on a long train trip in the summer of 1990, the idea came to her of a boy who has magic but doesn't know it. In 1992 Rowling began to teach English. She lived with her baby daughter, Jessica, and spent much time finishing the first Harry Potter book for young readers. It appeared in June 1997. To her surprise, the book was greatly successful. The film came out in November 2001. Now Harry Potter series   is popular with people of all ages and about 60 million books were sold in 200 countries.\nWhy has the series been so successful? There are a few things. Many other magical stories take place in faraway lands or in past or future times. But Harry lives in modern   England. He's also a very normal   boy: polite, friendly, brave and clever. So when other children read about Harry,  they can imagine being like him.\nJ.K. Rowling is very happy with the success, and she is now busy finishing the whole series of seven books. She's writing full time and she's really enjoying life.

One day, some old friends told him it would be fun. After taking drugs only once, he found it very hard to stop. Liang began to spend all his time and money on drugs. Soon, he stopped going to school and started stealing. In the end, he was put in prison.\nIn China, taking drugs is becoming a big problem for teens. According to a survey, about one million people in China were using illegal drugs last year, and 72% of them were young people. Worse still, there are about10,000 drug users under 16 now.\nZhang has some good advice on staying clean. He said, \"Drugs are dangerous. Never try them, even if you're curious!

However, with the fast development of mobile phones, it has lost its place in people's everyday life. In order to save their loved red phone boxes, people have come up with many ideas, for example, to turn them into toilets or art houses.\nIn a village in Somerset, a place in South West England, villagers have found a new way to save their red phone box. They turned it into a mini library to deal with the shortage of libraries in their area. The idea was given by a local villager, Janet Fisher, who lives opposite the phone box. Villagers got together to set up the book box. Over 100 books and a lot of movies and music CDs are available at this mini library. The books are of different kinds, including from cooking books to the classics and children's books. People can put the books that they have read inside the phone box, and take away the books that they'd like to read. The books are always changing. There is a regular check on the books to keep the phone box collection fresh.\nAnyone is free to come to read books there. The phone box library is open every day around the clock and is lit (the past form of \"light\") at night.  \" It's very pleasing that the red phone box has been saved. More importantly, it can continue providing a service for us,\" said one of the villagers.",

I went to Chicago and knocked at the door of every station. But unluckily, I was refused every time.\nAt one station, a kind lady told me that big stations wouldn't hire  a person without any experience and suggested that I try my luck at smaller stations. Following her advice, I went back to Dixon, where I had grown up. There were no such jobs in Dixon, and my father said a newly-opened store wanted a local athlete to work for it. I wanted this job, but I was refused again.\n\"Everything happens for the best,\" Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to look for a job. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer.\nAs I left his office, I felt so frustrated. \"How can I become a sports announcer if I can't get a job in a radio station?\" I asked aloud.\nWhile I was waiting for the elevator, I heard someone calling. It was MacArthur. \"What was that you said about sports? Do you know anything about football?\" Then he asked me to have a try. He was pleased with my performance, and he offered me a chance to work there.\nOn my way home, I thought of my mother's words: \"If you carry on, one day something good will happen. Something wouldn't have happened if without the failure before.\"",

But computer injuries slowly.\nYou probably know how to ride a bike safely. Now learn to use a computer safely.\nYour eyes\nToo much light can injure your eyes, so never sit too close to a computer screen. Your eyes should be at least 50 centimeters from the screen. Remember to look away from it sometimes. This gives your eyes a rest.\nWhen you use a computer, the window should be on your left or your right. If it is behind you, the light will reflect on   the screen. If the window is in front of you, the sun and the screen will both shine into your eyes.\nYour hands and wrists  \nHand and wrist injuries can happen because the hands and wrists are moved in the same way hundreds of times. If you use a keyboard for a long time, follow these three rules: 1) Rest your wrists on something. 2) Keep your elbows at the same height as the keyboard. 3) Stop something and exercise your hands, wrists and fingers in a different way.\nYour back\nSome people sit for many hours in front of a computer. If you sit in the wrong way, you can injure your back or your neck. So you should sit with your back straight. The top part of the screen should all be in front of your eyes. Your forearms, wrists, hands and the upper part of your legs should all be parallel   to the floor. If you are sitting for a long time, get up every 30 minutes and exercise your arms, legs and necks.\nEnjoy your computer, but use it safely.",

Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain  . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links   disappears.\nAll life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil   and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly.\nWhat about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses.\nEach form of life is linked   to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger.",

Some younger kids may have them because their parents see it as a matter of safety and convenience. For example, a kid can call mom and dad when sports practice is over. And a cell phone can give kids almost instant access  to their parents if something goes wrong or they need help. It can give parents quick access to their kids so they can check on them and make sure they're OK.\nIf you do get a cell phone, make some rules with your parents, such as how many minutes you're allowed to spend on the phone, when you can use your phone, when the phone must be turned off, and what you will do if someone calls you too often, and so on.\nYou'll also have to learn to take care of the phone in your life. Keep it charged  and store it in the safe place so it doesn't get lost. And whatever you do, don't use it in the bathroom. I know someone who dropped her phone in the toilet!",

    "article": "The Internet joins millions of computers all over the world, and it's used by people all over the world. It was invented in the 1960s in the USA. The American government needed a network of computers for its army. Then in the 1970s scientists and businesspeople also wanted to use the Internet to send and receive messages. For some years, they weren't allowed to use US network, and when they were allowed to, the messages were in very simple text without photos.\nThe World Wide Web was invented by a British scientist named Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He wanted to send documents to other scientists. So he developed the World Wide Web. This allowed him to send and receive scientific documents with text, drawings and photos. In the 1990s, more and more people began to use the Internet and the World Wide Web.\nSo, what's the difference between Internet and the World Wide Web? The Internet is the hardware .It allows us to communicate with other people. The World Wide Web is the software. It allows us to create , see, and read multimedia documents.\nThe web is made up of millions of documents called web pages. These pages are held in computers all over the world. Many people have a favourite website with a number of web pages on the same subject.\nEmail is a way of using your computer to send and receive messages. It's cheaper and quicker to use email than send normal mail. New users call normal mail \"snail mail\" because it's so slow.\nIt took 50 years for 100 million people to listen to the radio. It took 15 years for 100 million people to watch television. By the year 2000, it had taken only about three years for 100 million people to use the Internet. What will happen next on the Internet?",

    "article": "Almost every child in big cities has the chance to go to school. Nine years' studying helps children to prepare for their future lives. In fact, many students can study for more than nine years. Not all children are so lucky.\nThere is a girl called Xiao Fang. She is eight years old and lives in a small village in Guangxi. When she was younger, she wanted to go to school, but she could not because her family was too poor. The schools were too expensive, so her parents kept her at home. Instead of studying, Xiao Fang worked in the fields with her parents.\nThen Project Hope heard about Xiao Fang. It agreed to help Xiao Fang to go to school. Her wish came true, and now she is studying in a school. Unluckily, there are many thousands of children who can not go to school. You can help these children.\nProject Hope also helps to repair school buildings.\nAll this good work costs money. Project Hope needs your help. If you give Project Hope Y=300, we can pay for one child to go to school for a whole year. With more money, Project Hope can build new schools. The money buys good desks, chairs, blackboards and books. To help us is to help Xiao Fang and many other children to have a good start in life.",

    "article": "The keys to reaching or staying at a healthy weight are regular exercise and good eating habits. Teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity a day. Note the word \"activity\". As long as you're getting your body moving, it doesn't have to mean doing difficult exercise or going to the sports hall every day. All that matters is that each week you get the right balance of activity, including aerobics  , strength building, and flexibility   exercise. Make exercise a habit by arranging some time every day.\nOn days when you have soccer practice or an aerobics class, you may have no trouble exercising for an hour or more. But most of us are busy, and 60 minutes a day for exercise seems like a lot of time. The good news is that it's OK to divide it into shorter exercise breaks throughout the day.\nJust as you might have a healthy snack to stop yourself from getting hungry, exercise snacks can keep energy levels high. So get up 15 minutes early and do some stretching   activity. Walk fast or run slowly for 15 minutes after lunch. Do the same thing after school -- or walk or bike home. Add to that taking the stairs, PE class, and walking between classes during the day, and you've probably reached your 60 minutes.\nHere are five simple ways to make an exercise lifestyle change:",

You have to stay and work, don't you?\"\n\"Work?\" Tom said. \"This isn't work. I'm enjoying myself. Does a boy get a chance to paint a fence like this every day?\"\nBen thought about this. Tom continued painting carefully. Sometimes he stopped, stood back to look at the fence like an artist, and then added a bit more paint in just the right place. Ben was watching Tom paint with great interest. He was getting more and more eager to have a try himself.\nAfter a while, Ben asked Tom if he would let him paint a little. Tom thought about it, and said, \"No, Ben, I can't. You see. Aunt Polly wants it to be done well. Aunt Polly said that I must paint it with great care.\"\n\"Oh, please, Tom,\" begged Ben. \"I can do it. I'll be really careful. Just let me try. I'll give you half of my apple. Well, I'll give you all of it!\"\n\"Well, all right, Ben,\" said Tom. \"You must be very careful.\"\nHe gave Ben his brush with worry on his face but joy in his heart. He sat down under the tree, and started to eat Ben's apple. All day, boys came to make fun of Tom, but they ended up staying to paint. When Ben got tired, Billy was waiting. He gave Tom a kite for a chance to paint. Then Johnny offered him a basketball, and so on.\nBy late afternoon Tom had got all kinds of toys, and the fence had got three coats of paint. Later Aunt Polly came to look at the painted fence. She was so pleased with Tom's work that she gave Tom a large cake!",

Or join someone in some activity. Many people are nervous when talking to new people. After all, meeting strangers means facing the unknown. And it's human nature to feel a bit uncomfortable about the unknown.\nMost of our fears about dealing with new people come from doubts about ourselves. We imagine other people are giving an opinion about us-finding us too tall or too short, too this or too that. But don't forget that they must be feeling the same away. Try to accept yourself as you are, and try to put the other person at ease . You'll both feel more comfortable.\nTry to keep self-confident even when you don't feel that way when you enter a room full of strangers, such as a new classroom, walk tall and straight, look directly at other people and smile. If you see someone you'd like to speak to, say something. Don't wait for the other person to start a conversation.\nJust meeting someone new does not mean that you will make friends with that person-friendship is based on each other's liking and \"give and take\".

However, when she first walked past the students in the school, her excitement turned to fear, and then to loneliness over the next few days. \"Why didn't anyone say 'hi' to me or invite me to his or her lunch table? Is it because of my clothes or my hair?\" she wondered. Almost every day during the first week, Anna stayed alone, thinking that there must have been something wrong with her or that nobody saw her at all!\nWhat caused Anna's problem? The reason was that nobody knew her. Most people don't like talking with strangers  . So it's your job to volunteer to make contact with people who you want to know. The easiest way to catch their attention is to notice them first. Make eye contact with them and smile at them. When you smile at them, you are doing your best to show your kindness to them, and they are sure to understand that you are saying, \"Hey, how's everything going?\" In this way, you are taking the first step towards the road to friendship.\nWhen Anna realized this, she started talking to her classmates. Guess what happened? It really worked. She had made two friends by the end of the month.\nIn fact, saying \"hi\" or making friends with strangers is not hard. And the joy it brings you is really great. So try to open your heart to strangers!",

They even sound better than violins made today. Violin makers and scientists try to make instruments  like the Italian violins. But they aren't the same. Musicians still prefer the old ones.\nSome people think it is the age of the violins. But not all old violins sound wonderful. Only the old violins from Cremona are special . So age cannot be the answer.\nOther people think the secret to those violins is the wood. The wood must be from certain kinds of trees.\nBut the kind of wood may not be so important. It may be more important to cut the wood in a special way. Wood for a violin must be cut very carefully. It has to be the right size and shape . The smallest difference will change the sound of the violin. Musicians sometimes think that this was the secret of the Italians. Maybe they understood more than we do about how to cut the wood.\nSize and shape may not be the answer, either. Scientists can make new ones that are exactly the same size and shape. But the new violins still do not sound as good as the old ones. Some scientists think the secret may be the varnish. Varnish is what covers the wood of the violin. It makes the wood look shiny. It also helps the sound of the instrument. But no one knows what the Italian violin makers used in their varnish.",

I told her about my situation. She suggested that I should do a course and get a qualification if I wanted to work with children. I didn't think I would be accepted because I didn't take many exams in school. She asked me to phone the local college and they were really helpful.

    "article": "One thing that British and Chinese cultures share is a love for tea. Today, when we think of western tea culture, we often think of the English and beautiful china tea cups.\nAfternoon tea:\nPeople believe that an English lady, Anna, first introduced the idea of afternoon tea. In the 18thand 19thcenturies, the English ate only two main meals each day, breakfast and a heavy supper that would last for several hours in the evening. As a result, people often got very hungry during the long wait between these two meals. To solve this problem, Anna came up with the clever idea of inviting some friends to join her for an afternoon meal between four and five o'clock. This meal included cakes, sandwiches, and tea was served to wash down the food. In order to make this afternoon meal important, fine china cups, plates, and silver teapots, knives, forks and spoons were used. Soon, afternoon tea parties became popular _ . Today, afternoon tea parties continue to play an important part in the social life in modern Britain.\nWill you come for coffee:\nCoffee also has an important role in British culture. People often use words \"Will you come for coffee?\" to mean \"Would you like to come to my home for a chat?\" Normally, several different drinks such as tea, hot chocolate or a soft drink like orange juice will be served as well as coffee, and you will be asked what you would like. However, you will not normally be offered wine at a \"coffee\" party.\nCoffeehouses and the London Stock Exchange:\nIn the 17thcentury London coffeehouses were busy and noisy places. Businessmen and bankers went to coffeehouses to do their business, as well as to drink coffee. In fact, the London Stock Exchange is believed to be started from these coffeehouses.",

A taxi driver has to have not only skills but also a good knowledge of the city of London, from the smaller road to the most popular bar around. He has to be at service of all kinds of passengers at all times.\nA certain London taxi driver told of his job as follows.\nDuring the night it is quite usual for him to stop two or three times for some refreshments  . He said, \"I never drink when I'm working --- I would lose my license.\"\nHe usually goes home between 2 and 3 o'clock in the night. There are times he has to stay longer and try to make more runs. He said, \"That's the worst thing about working for yourself. If you don't make any money, no one is going to give it to you.\"\nLondon taxi drivers not only \"take\" but also \"give\". Every summer hundreds of children from London will go for a day at the sea --- by taxi! Their rides are paid by the taxi drivers, and these all go to the \"London Taxi for _ \". At the sea, they are met by the mayor  , and a lunch party is also held in honor of the taxi drivers and the children.

As it turned out, the experience I got at the hospital taught me the opposite: my future was not in vet medicine. However, there is one particular Saturday morning that taught me something maybe more important.\nThe hospital was in the middle of one of the poorer sections of the city and we often had people come in who could just only pay for the most basic treatments. This Saturday a man and his young son, who was probably about 7 years old, walked in with a small cat in a cardboard box. I remember the cat had an eye infection   but the man could not afford to pay for the cost of the medicine in addition to the exam. When he asked where the nearest the animal shelter  was, his son cried and started to argue with his father. _ an older woman who was sitting in the waiting room stood up, walked up to the counter, and told the man that she would pay for anything that he could not afford. The man thanked her and the son got to keep a healthy cat.\nI had always thought it was the right thing to help out a needy person, but it was only seen on TV or in movies. The woman in the vet's office taught me that these things do happen in real life, and should happen more often. When I am hesitant   to help someone who is in need, I remember that woman, and have the courage to do it. Sometimes other people follow.",

We hope you'll enjoy them.\nAbout 900 years ago two green children arrived in a small village in south England. Their eyes and skin were green and they spoke a strange language. They were very tired and weak, so the people of the village looked after them. The boy died a year later, but the girl grew strong and lived the rest of her life there. And her skin color turned back to normal day by day. Scientists say that sometimes of people don't have enough food to eat for a long time, their skin goes very pale and can turn green.\nLoch Ness is the largest lake in Scotland. It's a very deep and cold lake. For hundreds of years, people have talked about a monster  called Nessie which lives in the lake. About seventy years ago, two people saw something moving in the lake. They said that the animal was playing and rolling around in the water. Since then many people say they have seen the monster. Their descriptions are always the same. It looks like a dinosaur, with a very long neck and a small head. It has a big bump on its back. People have tried to photograph the animal, but the pictures have not been very clear. Scientists don't know whether there is a monster or not. Some say it may be a whale or a very large fish. Some think it's a snake. Others say there's nothing at all-- nothing but people's imagination. Maybe we'll never know what's in Loch Ness.",
